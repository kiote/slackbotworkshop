# Heroku setup

## Short overview

Heroku is a hosting for your service. You need to use a hosting, since you bot are going to be online even if your computer is off, and you are sleeping and on vacation.

## Create new application

1. Login to heroku \(you should have login and password from Installation step\)
2. Create new app: [https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app)
3. Choose app name \(anything works here, doesn't really matter\), I used currency-bot-123 for this example 
4. Choose region: Europe
5. Click "Create new app"

## Deployment configuration

You'll see new application configuration page with a lot of details, but fear not, we'll drag you through!

1. For "Deployment method" click on "Github"
2. New window with "Authorize application" title will appear, click "Authorize heroku"
