# Heroku setup

Heroku is a hosting for your service. You need to use a hosting, since you bot are going to be online even if your computer is off, and you are sleeping and on vacation.

1. Create new app: [https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app)
2. Choose app name \(anything works here, doesn't really matter\), I used currency-bot-123 for this example 
3. Choose region: Europe
4. Click "Create new app"

## Deployment configuration
