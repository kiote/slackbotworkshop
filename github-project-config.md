# Github project configuration

## Short overview

During this step, we will create and store out bot's source code \(program!\) in the github. That is needed for several reasons: 

* you can easily access this code any time you need from different computes \(since it's going to be published in the internet\)
* you can track the changes of your code \(git does history saving for you\), so you don't need to be afraid to make any changes to your code
* you can share your code with other developers so they will be able to help you to identify a problem remotely, if needed.
